# GraphQLExample

For this project to work you need to complete the following tasks:

 1. Create X1_SendGridKey, X1_FromEmail and X1_ConnectionString (although this one is not used in the demo) environment variables.
 1. Create the database. This won't work if you haven't done step one:

```PS> Update-Database```

Use this code at your own risk.
